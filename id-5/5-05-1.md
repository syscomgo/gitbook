# Event

## Generate events

This API can be called to generate events when an abnormal situation occurs.

\*Method: POST

* URL:/rest/monitor/api/event/create/
* Post body: as follows

```python
{
  "security": "<security code>",
  "title": "<Event title>",
  "content": "<event content>",
  "severity": "<Severity level, fill in 1-5>",
  "omflow_restapi": 1,
  "source2": "<source>"
}
```

The above Post body is the basis for converting the content into an event. The severity level is divided into five levels, namely 1 (Info), 2 (Normal), 3 (Warning), 4 (Major), and 5 (Critical). For example, If the severity level is Warning, fill in 3 for the severity parameter. In addition, source2 is an index string that concatenates the same events of the same device, which will be further explained in the next chapter.

> All APIs must obtain a security code (security) before using it. For how to obtain it, please refer to the chapter \[RESTAPI > Security Code].

## Close event

When the abnormal situation is eliminated, you can call this API to close the event. The system will close all events that match the specified source2 string.

\*Method: POST

* URL:/rest/monitor/api/event/close/
* Post body: as follows

```python
{
  "security": "<security code>",
  "omflow_restapi": 1,
  "source2": "<source>"
}
```
