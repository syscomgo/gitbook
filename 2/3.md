# Software and Hardware Requirements

## Hardware requirements

OMFLOW requires at least 1 Core CPU, 1GB RAM and more than 1GB disk space.

## Software requirements

You must install Python 3.0 or higher for OMFLOW in advance. You must install the Django package before installing OMFLOW.

## Database support

The open source version uses the built-in SQLite. If you need to use other databases, please refer to the Djanog manual for integration.

Supported databases include:

* PostgreSQL
* MS SQL Server
* MySQL
* Oracle
* SQLite

## Recommended specifications

The following recommendations are for the minimum specifications required to implement OMFLOW. Generally speaking, giving more computing resources can effectively improve the execution efficiency of the flow and operation.

| Number of concurrent users | CPU\(Core\) | RAM\(GB\) | Disk\(GB\) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1~5 people, manage 2 devices | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 5~20 people, manage 10 devices | 2 | 4 | 10 |
| More than 20 people, manage 50 devices | 4 | 8 | 100 |

## Port used

The port number of the open source version can be specified at startup, and the default port is 8000.

The free and commercial versions use Apache web server, the default port is 80, and the default port of the data collector is 5168.
