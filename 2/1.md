# OMFLOW Overview

OMFLOW is a fairly versatile flow engine. You can design forms freely for people to fill out and define processing procedures, and it can also help you flow data flow and automated commands.

OMFLOW is divided into Server and Collector. The role of Server is the data center, responsible for collecting and storing data and flow execution. Collector is a flow that can be used as a server for distributed computing and is dispatched to be executed regularly.

Generally speaking, users connect to OMFLOW Server through a browser to operate the entire OMFLOW system, and design apps on OMFLOW Server.

In OMFLOW Server, you can design your own APP, or download our written APP from the cloud for use. The APP can contain multiple FLOWs, and FLOW is composed of forms and workflows. In this way, Combine business flow with actual data or automated commands. Of course, OMFLOW includes the concept of a workspace. You can export, import and download any APP at any time. As long as you don't do the action on the shelf, it will not have any impact on the system.

Collector is a very important concept for us. OMFLOW is developed in Python language, so you can also embed Python code in the flow. When the Python code in the flow is to be executed, you can set it as a distributed operation. The actions of these operations will be automatically distributed to each Collector.

Of course, Collector, as the name suggests, also includes accepting external calls to transfer data to the center, and actively executing flow to obtain the required data.
