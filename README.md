# OMFLOW Overview

\#OMFLOW Overview

OMFLOW is a very versatile process engine. You can freely design forms for people to fill in and define processing procedures. It can also help you process data flows and automated commands.

OMFLOW is divided into Server and Collector. The role of Server is the data center, responsible for collecting and storing data and process execution. Collector can be used as a server to perform distributed computing and dispatch processes for regular execution.

Generally speaking, users connect to OMFLOW Server through a browser to operate the entire OMFLOW system and design apps on OMFLOW Server.

In OMFLOW Server, you can design your own APP, or you can download the APP we wrote from the cloud and use it. The APP can contain multiple FLOWs, and FLOWs are composed of forms and workflows. In this way, we , combine business processes with actual data or automated commands. Of course, OMFLOW includes the concept of a workspace. You can export, import and download any APP at any time. As long as you do not put it on the shelf, it will not have any impact on the system.

Collector is a very important concept for us. OMFLOW is developed using Python language, so you can also embed Python code in the process. When the Python code in the process is to be executed, you can set it to distributed computing. In this way, these operations will be automatically distributed to each Collector.

Of course, as the name implies, Collector also includes accepting external calls to transfer data to the center, and actively executing processes to obtain the required data.
