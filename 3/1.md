{% endhint %}

### First step,execute the installation file

OMFLOW's Windows installation package contains Apache, Python and its required packages, so you can install it directly through the installation package without pre-preparing the environment.

####  Select database

If you choose the default SQLite for the database during installation, although you don't need to install it separately, SQLite is used in an environment where business performance is more demanding. Compared with a commercial database, there is a considerable gap in performance. Therefore, it is more recommended to use a relational database, such as PostgreSQL or MySQL or SQL Server and Oracle.

_**Before installation, please create a database and create a database table and an account with permissions to read and write the database.**_



### Second step, select the type to be installed

#### OMFLOW Server \(Data Center\)

OMFLOW Server \(data center\) is the central server of OMFLOW software. It is responsible for data storage, process and scheduling execution and calculation. It is also the interface used by users to connect. We recommend installing it on a host with better performance.
