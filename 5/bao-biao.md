## Self-use Report

All reports created and saved by yourself are self-use reports. If they are set to public, they will only be viewed in their own word-use reports. The reports can be previewed and printed in real time or exported as CSV files without saving.

## Public Report

All reports created by other users and set as public. Public reports allow all users without process permissions to set the same output reports. If they have the same process permissions, they can be copied and created as self-use reports for editing.
