# Default Flow

## Sending flow

Recipients, copies, and confidential documents are directly filled in the recipientâ€™s mailbox location, and multiple recipients are separated by; as a separation, you can also directly select the organization, and the assignee can use the mailbox location filled in by the user in the system to select the organization, The assignee will write the assignee into the recipient and send a letter together. If only the organization is selected, all users in the organization are the recipients. Practical examples can refer to the incident management flow of service management.
