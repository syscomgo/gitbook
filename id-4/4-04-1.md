# Service Management

## Service Management

OMFLOW provides basic ITSM related processes for customers to use.

### Incident Management

When equipment anomalies or IT maintenance emergencies occur, this order can be opened to carry out the accident troubleshooting process. The following is a general introduction to the process:

|           Open an order           |  →  | Assign a checkpoint |  →  |    Process a checkpoint   |  →  |   Close an order  |
| :-------------------------------: | :-: | :-----------------: | :-: | :-----------------------: | :-: | :---------------: |
| Notify all groups of the incident |     |       Reassign      |     | Troubleshoot the incident |     | Notify the biller |
|     Notify assigned department    |     | Resolve immediately |     |    Return to assignment   |     |                   |
|                                   |     |   Cancel incident   |     |                           |     |                   |

> ※ You can pre-set the default\_inc\_group\_id of "Parameter Management" and specify the default assigned department ID

### Problem Management

When the same accident still occurs after the accident ticket has been eliminated, this ticket can be opened to eliminate the root cause of the problem. The following is a general process introduction:

\| Open an order | → | Assign a checkpoint | → | Investigate a checkpoint | → | Process a checkpoint | → | Close an order | | :----------: | :-: | :----------: | :-: | :----------: | :- : | :------: | :-: | :----------: | | Notify assigned department | | Assign investigators | | Assign handlers | | Root out the problem | | Notify billers | | | | Exclude now | | | | Exclude status | | | | | | Cancel question | | | | | | |

> ※ You can pre-set the default\_pro\_group\_id of "Parameter Management" and specify the default assigned department ID

### Change Management

When assets or network structures change, a change order can be issued, and the change steps are determined based on the type of change. The following is a general process introduction:

#### Standard changes

There is no design review process for standard changes.

|                New →               |  →  |             Scheduled →            |  →  |               Close →              |    Close order    |
| :--------------------------------: | :-: | :--------------------------------: | :-: | :--------------------------------: | :---------------: |
| Notify the change processing group |     | Notify the change processing group |     | Notify the change processing group | Notify the biller |

#### General changes

Generally, changes are the most rigorous process, and there are three stages of review: pre-development review, pre-launch review, and case closure review.

|              New              | Pre-development review | Pre-launch review |           Scheduled           |  Closing review  |   Close order  |
| :---------------------------: | :--------------------: | :---------------: | :---------------------------: | :--------------: | :------------: |
| Notify change processing team |    Notify reviewers    |  Notify reviewers | Notify change processing team | Notify reviewers | Notify billers |

#### Emergency changes

There is no pre-development review for emergency changes, and it is designed to be a two-stage review: pre-launch review and final review.

\| New → | → | Review before going online | Scheduled | → | Closing review | Close order | | :----------------: | :-: | :----------: | :----------------: | :- : | :----------: | :----------: | | Notify change processing team | | Notify reviewers | Notify change processing team | | Notify reviewers | Notify billing staff |

> ※ You can pre-set the default\_cha\_group\_id of "Parameter Management", specify the default assigned department ID and default\_cha\_review\_group\_id, and specify the default reviewer ID
