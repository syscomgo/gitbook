## Update built-in process

When the version is updated, it prompts that the "built-in process" needs to be updated. In order to use the new functions correctly, you may need to manually update the built-in process. The following are the update steps:

#### STEP1 Enter application design

Click **Main Menu**＞**Application Management**＞**Application Design**

#### STEP2 Click "Download"

Click the blue **Download** button in the upper right corner of the screen, and the cloud process interface will pop up.

> ※ Cloud download can only be carried out when there is an Internet connection. If there is no Internet connection, you can jump to STEP4.

Click on OMFLOW default APP and press the **Import** button on the right side of OMFLOW Default APP.

#### STEP3 Put it on the shelves

Check the "Built-in Process" application you want to apply and click the "Publish" button to update.

#### STEP4 Import the built-in process in the installation folder

If the environment where OMFLOW is located does not have a network, you can also find the file in the installation folder. Click the "Import" button and find the OMFLOW Server installation folder `C:\Program Files\OMFLOW Server\omflow\default_flow_<language>.omf`. After importing, you can continue with STEP3 to put it on the shelves.
