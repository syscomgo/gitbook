# Create applications and processes

## Create applications and processes

This chapter demonstrates how to create and design a simple process.

### Create application

```
Location: [Main Menu]>Application Management>Application Design>New
```

Click the **Add** button at the top of the main screen, enter "Practice Application" and press the **OK** button. The application just created will be displayed in the list.

### Create new process

```
Location: [Main Menu]>Application Management>Application Design>[Application Name]
```

Click on the application just created to enter the process list screen. And click the **New** button at the top of the main screen and select **Form Process** to create the first new process.

After creation, you will switch to the **Parameter Setting** interface of the process. Please complete the following fields:\
● Process name: Practice process\
● API path: practice-flow

> ※ This example does not modify other checked items. For details, please refer to the chapter \[Application Management > Parameter Settings]

### Form design

```
Location: [Main Menu] > Application Management > Application Design > [Application Name] > [Process Name] > Form Design
```

Click the "Form Design" tab and you will see a blank form. Click the **Half Block** button at the top of the main screen twice.

Click the **＋** button in the left block to add the following fields:\
● Title\
● Input

Click the **＋** button in the right block to add the following fields:\
● Status\
● light signal

In the **Status** column just created, click the \[**Gear**] button and switch to the **Options** tab, and add the following options:

| value | display text |
| ----- | ------------ |
| 1     | New          |
| 2     | Review       |
| 3     | Pass         |
| 0     | Reject       |

### Process Design

```
Location: [Main Menu]>Application Management>Application Design>[Application Name]>[Process Name]>Process Design
```

Click the "Process Design" tab, and you will see the preset process. This process is deliberately designed with logic that will not close orders. Next, modify the process:

> Practice situation:\
> ● After placing an order, the "Title" and "Input" will be added together and then filled back into the input field for the user to check.\
> ● After the user confirms that everything is correct, change the status to passed and end the process.\
> ● If the status selected by the user is not passed, return to the manual input component again.

#### Add new component

Click the **Add** button above and check the **Program Code** component

#### Link components

Before making the connection, let’s first introduce the three operations of designing process routes:

**Drag component**

> ● Press and hold \[Component]\
> ● Move the mouse

**Create link**

> ● Click on the \[component] as the starting point to enter the interactive state\
> ● Click any **○** button in the interactive state "Left, Right, Down" until it turns green\
> ● Move the mouse over the "component" considered as the end point\
> ● Click on any of the **○** buttons that appear

**Delete link**

> ● Click on the \[component] as the starting point to enter the interactive state\
> ● Click the **○** button with the link until it turns green\
> ● Method 1: Click the green **○** button again\
> ● Method 2: Move the mouse over the \[Component] that is considered the end point, and click the **○** button that connects the end point

Once you understand the operation, complete the following goals:\
● Delete the link between "Start, Manual Input"\
● Drag the "Execute (code)" component you just created to the middle of "Start, Manual Input"\
● Connect each component in this order: start → execute → manual input → judge → end\
● Create an additional link in the "Judgment" component: Judgment → Manual Input

#### Set component

After the flow chart structure is completed, the next step is to set the function, input, and output of each component.

**"Start" component**

```
            Location: Process Design>[Start Component]>[Gear]>Input>New
```

Click \[Start Component] on the flow chart to enter the interactive state, find the specified location through the above sequence, and complete the following settings:

| Input data   | Variable name  | Description |
| ------------ | -------------- | ----------- |
| success      | result         |             |
| Field: Title | title          |             |
| Field: input | input          |             |
|              | python\_result |             |

> ※ What is set here is the starting variable of the process, which can be brought in by other components.

**"Code" component**

**"Input" tab**

```
            Location: Process Design>[Code Components]>[Gear]>Input>New
```

Click the \[Code Component] on the flow chart to enter the interactive state, find the specified location through the above sequence, and complete the following settings:

| Input data      | Variable name | Description |
| --------------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| Variable: title | a             |             |
| Variable: input | b             |             |
|                 | c             |             |

> ※ a, b, c are variables brought into the python code by the process, and only the variables created here can be brought back into the process.

**"Python" tab**

```
            Location: Process Design＞[Programming Components]＞[Gear]＞Python
```

You can enter your own Python code here to meet various customer needs. This example defines a mergeInput method, adds the a and b variables as strings, and finally returns the addition result. The following is an example:

```python
def mergeInput(title, text):
    ans = title + text
    return ans


c = mergeInput(a,b)
```

> ※ All variables input from the process are of **string** type.

**"Output" tab**

```
            Location: Process Design>[Programming Components]>[Gear]>Output
```

This will determine which variables of the input page are to be written back to the process variables. Please complete the following settings:

| Input data  | Variable name  | Description |
| ----------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| Variable: c | python\_result |             |

**"Manual processing" component**

The main function of the manual processing component is to stop the process, and then hand it over to the user to manually process and stack orders to continue the process. Here we will set that whenever the process enters this component, the **Status** field value will change to **Audit**.

| Enter data | Set up fields | Description |
| ---------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| 2          | Field: Status |             |

**"Conditional Judgment" component**

This component can set multiple links and decide which one to follow based on conditions.

| next element            | variable or field | condition | value |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- | --------- | ----- |
| Manual Input (FITEM\_2) | Field: Status     | Not Equal | 3     |
| End(FITEM\_4)           | Field: Status     |           | Equal |

> ※ When the condition judgment component satisfies multiple routes at the same time, the lowest route will be given priority.

### Save

When the process design is completed, click the **Save** button in the upper right corner of the main screen.

> ※ After the process is saved, it will not take effect immediately. It needs to be put on the shelf to take effect.

### On the shelves

```
Location: [Main Menu]>Application Management>Application Design
```

Click **Application Design** to return to the application list, check the application you just created, and then click the **Publish** button above the main screen. Select **Publish new application** and click **Confirm**.

If this application has already been listed, select **Replace Listed Application** to overwrite it.

> ※ It will take a while to be put on the shelves depending on the size of the application data, please be patient.

### Open form

```
Location: [Main Menu]>Apps>[Application Name]>[Process Name]
```

After the listing is completed, you can find the data list of the process in the above location, and click the **Add** button to open the form.
