# Use Docker

You can use OMFLOW Server directly through Docker Hub, eliminating the need for installation steps.

### Search OMFLOW

Use docker search omflow to search, and you can see that there are two types: open and server. Open is the open source version, and server is the free version. Different versions have different authorization methods, so pay special attention to this part.
