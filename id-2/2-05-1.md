# Install Booster

> The current Booster version only supports up to OMFLOW 1.1.6.3

## Features

### Load balancing architecture

When users need to place a large number of orders for a long time or many users are online at the same time, extremely performance-consuming situations occur, making it difficult for a single OMFLOW Server to load. A load balancing mechanism is provided for this. Multiple OMFLOW Servers can be built at the same time to disperse the performance, and the Booster can be coordinated to improve the overall efficiency. The architecture diagram is as follows:

### Load balancing and high availability architecture

At the same time, OMFLOW also provides a high-availability architecture, dividing the Booster into two "primary and secondary" servers. All OMFLOW Servers will report to the Booster in this order to ensure that the system can still operate normally when any node in this architecture loses contact.

#### OMFLOW Booster

Serves as the data delivery center and is mainly responsible for cooperating with all OMFLOW Servers to process the form process. Normally, the main Booster does the work. When the primary Booster loses contact, the secondary Booster will take over the job, forming a high-availability architecture.

#### OMFLOW Booster Agent

When using the Booster architecture, the Booster Agent needs to be installed in the same environment as the OMFLOW Server. Its function is that when any OMFLOW Server updates a patch, all other OMFLOW Servers will also be automatically updated.

## installation steps

### 1. Environmental requirements

Booster server: Recommended at least 4 core 8 GB for installing OMFLOW Booster

Python: Make sure the Python version of Booster and OMFLOW Server is 3.7.7 or above

Port: Ensure that port 5169 between Booster and OMFLOW Server is open to each other

### 2. Install OMFLOW Booster

Prioritize installation and install one or two Boosters according to the situation. There is no order requirement for the two. The following information needs to be filled in during installation:

#### Enter the local IP/Domain and Port:

Fill in the IP/Domain and Port represented by this Booster, and ensure that all OMFLOW Servers are connected to this.

> In addition to Booster, OMFLOW Server also needs to open port 5169.

#### Enter HA Booster IP/Domain and Port (optional):

When the situation is HA architecture, fill in the IP/Domain and Port represented by the other Booster, and ensure that the two Boosters can communicate with each other.

> Under the HA architecture, one is the main Booster and the other is the secondary Booster.

> Linux installation method\
> Unzip it in the path where the installation package is placed, and execute install.sh.

```
tar xvf Booster_1140.tar.gz
cd Booster_1140
./install.sh
```

### 3. Build database

The Booster architecture does not support Sqlite, and the corresponding database needs to be created in advance. The databases supported by OMFLOW are as follows:

\*PostgreSQL \*MySQL

* SQL Server \*Oracle

> Prepare the database and an account with permissions to create tables and read and write the database.

### 4. Install OMFLOW Server

After the Booster is installed, install the **first OMFLOW Server** of this architecture. The installation process will require the following additional information:

#### Enter DB related information:

Please enter the database related information prepared in the previous step.

#### Enter Booster IP and Port:

Please enter relevant information to be considered as the primary Booster.

#### Enter HA Booster IP and Port:

Please enter relevant information to be considered as a secondary booster.

#### OMFLOW Server has been installed previously:

If there is already a running OMFLOWServer before installing Booster, follow the steps below:

> Please back up the database before installation.

Make sure the running OMFLOW Server database is not Sqlite

1. Update OMFLOW Server to the latest version
2. Modify the setting.py file and fill in the Booster related information into the four parameters BOOSTER\_IP, BOOSTER\_PORT, SECOND\_BOOSTER\_IP, SECOND\_BOOSTER\_PORT
3. Restart OMFLOW Server

### 5. Install OMFLOW Booster Agent

After the first OMFLOW Server is installed, continue to install the OMFLOW Booster Agent on the same environment.

> BoosterAgent needs to be installed on the same server as OMFLOW Server.

#### Linux installation method

Unzip it in the path where the installation package is placed, and execute install.sh.

```
tar xvf BoosterAgent_1140.tar.gz
cd BoosterAgent_1140
./install.sh
```

### 6. Install OMFLOW Slave

> Please back up the following before installation:
>
> 1. Database from step 3
> 2. OMFLOW Server in step 4.

After the above steps are completed, the final step is to install more than one OMFLOWSlave according to the needs of the situation. OMFLOWSlave already contains OMFLOW Server and OMFLOWBooster Agent. During the installation process, you will need to fill in the following additional information:

#### Enter Booster IP and Port:

Please enter relevant information to be considered as the primary Booster.

#### Enter HA Booster IP and Port:

Please enter relevant information to be considered as a secondary booster.

#### Windows installation method

There is an independent installation file omflow\_slave\_1\_1\_4\_0.exe for execution.

#### Linux installation method

Refer to the installation method in the \[**Installation on Linux**] chapter, just enter the type as Slave.

## Startup sequence

In the startup sequence, Booster and DB have the highest priority, and then start all Booster Agents.

1. Booster, Database
2. Booster Agent

> When Booster Agent starts, it will automatically start OMFLOW Server.

#### Linux service startup method

Booster

```
/opt/omflow/Booster/omflow_booster_service { start | stop | status }
```

BoosterAgent

```
/opt/omflow/BoosterAgent/omflow_booster_agent_service { start | stop | status }
```
