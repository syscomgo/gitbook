# Change data center URL

## Change data center URL

The server will need to change the certificate, connection port, domain, IP, etc. due to various factors including but not limited to organizational changes, equipment architecture changes, server abnormalities, etc. This article mainly explains what needs to be modified. Only in this way can the data center operate normally.

### Windows

#### Modify httpd.conf

> File path: `C:\Program Files\OMFLOW Server\Apache24\conf\httpd.conf`

Modify \<IP> and \<Port> in the following two settings

```
# Listen: Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses and/or
# ports, instead of the default. See also the <VirtualHost>
# directive.
#
# Change this to Listen on specific IP addresses as shown below to
# prevent Apache from glomming onto all bound IP addresses.
#
#Listen 12.34.56.78:80
Listen <IP>:<Port>
```

```
# ServerName gives the name and port that the server uses to identify itself.
# This can often be determined automatically, but we recommend you specify
# it explicitly to prevent problems during startup.
#
# If your host doesn't have a registered DNS name, enter its IP address here.
#
ServerName <IP>:<Port>
```

#### Modify settings.py

> File path: `C:\Program Files\OMFLOW Server\omflow\omflow\settings.py`

LOCAL_PORT = "80"
UNIQUE_ID = ""
LOCAL_PROTOCOL = "http"
```

#### Restart service

```
net stop OMFLOWServer
net start OMFLOWServer
```

#### Update collector registration location

> File path: `C:\Program Files\OMFLOW Collector\omflow\omflow\settings.py`

SERVER_PORT = "<Port>"
SERVER_PROTOCOL = "http"
