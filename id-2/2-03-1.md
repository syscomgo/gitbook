# Backup and restore

## Backup and restore

OMFLOW's backup and restore is divided into Windows and Linux. The steps are basically the same, but different environments are not interchangeable with each other.

### Windows

#### OMFLOW Server

**Backup steps**

1. Stop serving OMFLOW Server and OMFLOW Server Web
2. Backup folder `C:\Program Files\OMFLOW Server`
3. Dump the database OMFLOW dedicated DB

**Restore steps**

1. First restore the dumped DB
2. Install OMFLOW Server, refer to the chapter \[**Installation on Windows**]

> Notes:
>
> * When installing, select the "Don't use database" option
> * Update to the same version as the backup

3. Close the following services

> List: -OMFLOW Server
>
> * OMFLOW Server Web

4. Delete the following folders after installation

> `...\OMFLOW Server\omflow\omcustom\migrations`\
> `...\OMFLOW Server\omflow\omdashboard\migrations`\
> `...\OMFLOW Server\omflow\omflow\migrations`\
> `...\OMFLOW Server\omflow\omformflow\production`\
> `...\OMFLOW Server\omflow\omformflow\migrations`\
> `...\OMFLOW Server\omflow\omformmodel\migrations`\
> `...\OMFLOW Server\omflow\omldap\migrations`\
> `...\OMFLOW Server\omflow\ommessage\migrations`\
> `...\OMFLOW Server\omflow\ommission\migrations`\
> `...\OMFLOW Server\omflow\ommobile\migrations`\
> `...\OMFLOW Server\omflow\ommonitor\migrations`\
> `...\OMFLOW Server\omflow\omorganization\migrations`\
> `...\OMFLOW Server\omflow\omformflow\migrations`\
> `...\OMFLOW Server\omflow\ompolicymodel\migrations`\
> `...\OMFLOW Server\omflow\omreport\migrations`\
> `...\OMFLOW Server\omflow\omservice\migrations`\
> `...\OMFLOW Server\omflow\omuser\migrations`

5. Overwrite all backed up files
6. Modify...\OMFLOW Server\omflow\omflow\setting.py according to the new environment

> Project:
>
> * DATABASES: Ensure that the IP, Port and other related parameters of the new DB are correct
> * LOCAL\_IP: OMFLOW’s connecting IP, 0.0.0.0 is any IP
> * LOCAL\_PORT: OMFLOW’s connection port
> * LOCAL\_PROTOCOL: OMFLOW's SSL settings, choose one of http / https

7. Restart the OMFLOW Server service
